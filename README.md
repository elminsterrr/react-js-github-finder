Hi, I'm Przemek and my dream is to work as Junior JavaScript / React / React Native Developer. I'm looking for a work environment where I can learn from devs with real passion. It can be Apprenticeship Program or Junior Job, it doesn't matter for me.

The only one thing important to me is to learn as much as I possibly can, to gain experience and to get better every day.

Here is my portfolio page with projects I've built with React so far:

Regarding your task I didn't do "Log in with GitHub" button, beacuse I don't have enough experience with OAuth yet.
